# Project Overview
## Project Name
Eye Movement
## Project Link

## Project Description
Use your mouse to move the eyes of two synchronized human eyes.  This project is useful to demonstrate how the DOM elements are triggered by mouse events, which include mouse clicked, mouse moved, and mouse leave.
## Project Setup on Your Machine
his project can easily be started cloning the repository in your IDE terminal by copying the HTTPS link from the green code button on my Github repo page. 
## Project Improvement Opportunities
 For future improvements, I plan on adding more detailed features to the eyes to bring the eyes to life. Girls love beautifying their eye features with eyeliner, eyelashes, and eyeshadow.
